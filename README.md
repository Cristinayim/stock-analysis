# stock-analysis

##1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that we did in this module. Then, we'll determine whether refactoring our code successfully made the VBA script run faster.

##2. Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##3.Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
  1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
